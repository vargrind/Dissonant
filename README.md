# Dissonant

A Modular Discord Bot

## Installation

WIP

## Limitations

- Voice support will never realistically be added, due to it being impossible to join more than one channel at a time. The bot would require a stable API for Chords to request voice access; at that point, it is likely better to make separate, standalone bots for handling voice systems.
